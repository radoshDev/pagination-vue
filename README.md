### Pagination
At the bottom of the table there is pagination for more convenient use. 
### Sorting
To sort the data, just click on the table header of the column to be sorted.
### Filtering
There is also a convenient search for a user by name, you just need to start entering characters and you will be able to see the result.
### Removing users
Select the rows you want to remove by clicking on the checkbox and then click the "Remove" button in the table header.
